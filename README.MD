# Tiktok Usecase Study

TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner.

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

## Mission 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis

**The purpose** of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on a provided data set. Your mission is to continue the investigation you began in C2 and perform further EDA on this data with the aim of learning more about the variables. Of particular interest is information related to what distinguishes claim videos from opinion videos.

**The goal** is to explore the dataset and create visualizations.
<br/>
_This activity has 4 parts:_

**Part 1:** Imports, links, and loading

**Part 2:** Data Exploration

- Data cleaning

**Part 3:** Build visualizations

**Part 4:** Evaluate and share results

## Mission 2 - Hypothesis Tests

The team has reviewed the results of the exploratory data analysis and the previous executive summary the team prepared. You received an email from Orion Rainier, Data Scientist at TikTok, with your next assignment: determine and conduct the necessary hypothesis tests and statistical analysis for the TikTok classification project.

### Hypothesis

ùêª0
: There is no difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts (any observed difference in the sample data is due to chance or sampling variability).

ùêªùê¥
: There is a difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts (any observed difference in the sample data is due to an actual difference in the corresponding population means).

## Mission 3 - Regression Modeling

**The purpose** of this project is to demostrate knowledge of EDA and regression models.

**The goal** is to build a logistic regression model and evaluate the model.
<br/>
_This activity has three parts:_

**Part 1:** EDA & Checking Model Assumptions

- What are some purposes of EDA before constructing a logistic regression model?

**Part 2:** Model Building and Evaluation

- What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage?

**Part 3:** Interpreting Model Results

- What key insights emerged from your model(s)?

- What business recommendations do you propose based on the models built?

## Misson 4 - Classifying Videos Using Machine Learning

**The purpose** of this model is to mitigate misinformation in videos on the TikTok platform.

**The goal** of this model is to predict whether a TikTok video presents a "claim" or presents an "opinion".
<br/>

_This activity has three parts:_

**Part 1:** Ethical considerations

- Consider the ethical implications of the request

- Should the objective of the model be adjusted?

**Part 2:** Feature engineering

- Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling

**Part 3:** Modeling

- Build the models, evaluate them, and advise on next steps
